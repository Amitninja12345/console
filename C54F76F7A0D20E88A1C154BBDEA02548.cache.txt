"<p>A domain consists of one domain controller, one or more host controller(s), and zero or more server groups per host.</p>\n<img class=\"preview\" src=\"previews/domain.png\"/>\n<p>A domain controller is the central point from which the domain is controlled. It ensures that each server is configured according to the management policy of the domain. The domain controller is also a host controller.</p>\n<p>A host controller is a physical or virtual host on which the domain.sh or domain.bat script is run. Host controllers are configured to delegate domain management tasks to the domain controller. The host controller on each host interacts with the domain controller to control the lifecycle of the application server instances running on its host and to assist the domain controller to manage them. Each host can contain multiple server groups.</p>\n<p>A server group is a set of server instances which have JBoss EAP 6 installed on them and are managed and configured as one. The domain controller manages the configuration of and applications deployed onto server groups. Consequently, each server in a server group shares the same configuration and deployments.</p>\n",
"<p>A host controller is launched when the <code>domain.sh</code> or <code>domain.bat</code> script is run on a host.</p>\n\n<p>The primary responsibility of a host controller is server management. It delegates domain management tasks and is responsible for starting and stopping the individual application server processes that run on its host.</p>\n\n<p>It interacts with the domain controller to help manage the communication between the servers and the domain controller. Multiple host controllers of a domain can interact with only a single domain controller. Hence, all the host controllers and server instances running on a single domain mode have a single domain controller and must belong to the same domain.</p>\n\n<p>By default each host controller reads its configuration from the\n    <code>domain/configuration/host.xml</code> file located in the unzipped JBoss EAP 6 installation file on its host's filesystem. The\n    <code>host.xml</code> file contains the following configuration information that is specific to the particular host:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>The names of the JBoss EAP 6 instances meant to run from this installation.</li>\n    <li>Any of the following configurations:</li>\n    <ul>\n        <li>How the host controller contacts the domain controller to register itself and access the domain configuration.</li>\n        <li>How to find and contact a remote domain controller.</li>\n        <li> That the host controller is to act as the domain controller</li>\n    </ul>\n    <li>Configurations specific to the local physical installation. For example, named interface definitions declared in\n        <code>domain.xml</code> can be mapped to an actual machine-specific IP address in\n        <code>host.xml</code>.

"<p>A server group is a collection of server instances that are managed and configured as one.

Different server groups can be configured with different profiles and deployments. A domain can be configured with different server tiers providing different services, for example.</p>\n\n<p>Different server groups can also have the same profile and deployments.
