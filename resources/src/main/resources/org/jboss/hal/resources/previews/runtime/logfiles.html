<p>View server and application logs in order to help diagnose errors, performance problems, and other issues. For a log to be viewable, it must be located in the server's <code>jboss.server.log.dir</code> directory. The console also respects user RBAC role assignments, so a user can only view logs that they are authorized to access.</p>
