<p>A logical name for a filesystem path. The <code>domain.xml</code>, <code>host.xml</code> and
    <code>standalone.xml</code> configurations all include a section where paths can be declared. Other sections of the configuration can then reference those paths by their logical name, rather than having to include the full details of the path (which may vary on different machines).

<p>For example, the logging subsystem configuration includes a reference to the
    <code>jboss.server.log.dir</code> path that points to the server&#39;s <code>log</code> directory.</p>
