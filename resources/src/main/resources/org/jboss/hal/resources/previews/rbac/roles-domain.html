<h2>Standard Roles</h2>
<p>There are seven predefined user roles:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Monitor</li>
    <li>Operator</li>
    <li>Maintainer</li>
    <li>Deployer</li>
    <li>Auditor</li>
    <li>Administrator</li>
    <li>SuperUser</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these roles has a different set of permissions and is designed for specific use cases. The Monitor, Operator, Maintainer, Administrator, and SuperUser role each build upon each other, with each having more permissions than the previous. The Auditor and Deployer roles are similar to the Monitor and Maintainer roles respectively but have some additional special permissions and restrictions.</p>

<h2>Scoped Roles</h2>
<p>Scoped Roles are user-defined roles that grant the permissions of one of the standard roles but only for one or more specified server groups or hosts. Scoped roles allow for management users to be granted permissions that are limited to only those server groups or hosts that are required.</p>
<p>They are defined by five characteristics:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A unique name.</li>
    <li>Which of the standard roles it is based on.</li>
    <li>If it applies to Server Groups or Hosts</li>
    <li>The list of server groups or hosts that it is restricted to.</li>
    <li>If all users are automatically include. This defaults to false.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once created a scoped role can be assigned to users and groups the same way that the standard roles are.</p>
<p>Creating a scoped role does not let you define new permissions. Scoped roles can only be used to apply the permissions of an existing role in a limited scope. For example, you could create a scoped role based on the Deployer role which is restricted to a single server group.</p>
<p>There are only two scopes that roles can be limited to, host and server group.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Host-scoped roles</dt>
    <dd>A role that is host-scoped restricts the permissions of that role to one or more hosts. This means access is provided to the relevant /host=*/ resource trees but resources that are specific to other hosts are hidden.</dd>
    <dt>Server-Group-scoped roles</dt>
    <dd>A role that is server-group-scoped restricts the permissions of that role to one or more server groups. Additionally the role permissions will also apply to the profile, socket binding group, server config and server resources that are associated with the specified server-groups. Any sub-resources within any of those that are not logically related to the server-group will not be visible to the user.</dd>
