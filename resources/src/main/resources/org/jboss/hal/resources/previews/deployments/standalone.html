<p id="drag-and-drop-deployment">You can use
    <strong>drag and drop</strong> to add new content or replace existing deployments. Simply drag one or several files onto the deployment column. If there's already a deployment with the same name, the deployment will be replaced, otherwise the deployment will be added. The deployments added by drag and drop will be enabled by default.
