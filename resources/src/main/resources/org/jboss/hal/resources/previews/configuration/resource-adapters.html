<p>A resource adapter is a deployable Java EE component that provides communication between a Java EE application and an Enterprise Information System (EIS) using the Java Connector Architecture (JCA) specification. A resource adapter is often provided by EIS vendors to allow easy integration of their products with Java EE applications.</p>
<p>An Enterprise Information System can be any other software system within an organization. Examples include Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, database systems, e-mail servers and proprietary messaging systems.</p>
<p>A resource adapter is packaged in a Resource Adapter Archive (RAR) file which can be deployed to the server. A RAR file may also be included in an Enterprise Archive (EAR) deployment.</p>
