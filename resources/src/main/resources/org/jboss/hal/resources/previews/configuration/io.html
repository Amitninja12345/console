<p>The IO subsystem defines the XNIO workers and buffer pools used by other subsystems, such as Undertow and Remoting.</p>
<h2>Worker</h2>
<p>Workers are XNIO worker instances. An XNIO worker instance is an abstraction layer for the Java NIO APIs, which provide functionality such as management of IO and worker threads as well as SSL support. By default, JBoss EAP provides single worker called
    <code>default</code>, but more can be defined.</p>
<h2>Buffer Pool</h2>
<p>Buffer Pools are pooled NIO buffer instances.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong><br/>
    Changing the buffer size has a big impact on application performance. For most servers, the ideal size is usually 16k.
