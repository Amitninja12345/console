<p>A servlet container provides all servlet, JSP and websocket-related configuration, including session-related configuration. While most servers will only need a single servlet container, it is possible to configure multiple servlet containers by adding an additional servlet-container element. Having multiple servlet containers enables behavior such as allowing multiple deployments to be deployed to the same context path on different virtual hosts.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong><br/>
    Much of the configuration provided in by servlet container can be individually overridden by deployed applications using their <code>web.xml</code> file.</p>
