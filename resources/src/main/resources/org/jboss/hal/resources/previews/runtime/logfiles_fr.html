<p>View server and application logs in order to help diagnose errors, performance problems, and other issues. For a log to be viewable, it must be located in the server&#39;s
    <code>jboss.server.log.dir</code> directory. The console also respects user RBAC role assignments, so a user can only view logs that they are authorized to access.
</p>

<p>By default the console displays the last 2000 lines of a log file. If you want to view the log file as a whole, please choose &#39;Download&#39;. To view or follow the log file in a separate browser window choose &#39;Open in external window&#39;.</p>
