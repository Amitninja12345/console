<p>The elytron subsystem is new in ${build.fullName}. It is based on the WildFly Elytron project, which is a security framework used to unify security across the entire application server. The elytron subsystem enables a single point of configuration for securing both applications and the management interfaces. WildFly Elytron also provides a set of APIs and SPIs for providing custom implementations of functionality and integrating with the subsystem.</p>
