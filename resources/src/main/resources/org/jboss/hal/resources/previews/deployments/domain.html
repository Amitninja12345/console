<p>A deployment represents anything that can be deployed (e.g. an application such as EJB-JAR, WAR, EAR, any kind of standard archive such as RAR or JBoss-specific deployment) into a server.</p>
<p>Distributing deployment binaries involves two steps</p>
<ol>
    <li>uploading the deployment to the repository the domain controller will use to distribute its contents</li>
    <li>assigning the deployment to one or more server groups</li>
</ol>
