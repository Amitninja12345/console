<p>There are seven predefined user roles:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Monitor</li>
    <li>Operador</li>
    <li>Mantenedor</li>
    <li>Implementador</li>
    <li>Auditor</li>
    <li>Administrador</li>
    <li>Superusuario</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these roles has a different set of permissions and is designed for specific use cases. The Monitor, Operator, Maintainer, Administrator, and SuperUser role each build upon each other, with each having more permissions than the previous. The Auditor and Deployer roles are similar to the Monitor and Maintainer roles respectively but have some additional special permissions and restrictions.</p>
