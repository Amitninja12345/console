<p>Configure remote Java Management Extensions (JMX) access.</p>
<p>The JMX subsystem registers a service with the Remoting endpoint so that remote access to JMX can be obtained over the exposed Remoting connector.</p>
<p>This is switched on by default in standalone mode and accessible over port 9990 but in domain mode is switched off so needs to be enabled - in domain mode the port will be the port of the Remoting connector for the ${build.fullName} instance to be monitored.</p>
