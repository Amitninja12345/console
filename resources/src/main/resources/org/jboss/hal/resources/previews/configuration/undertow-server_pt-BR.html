<p>A server represents an instance of Undertow and consists of several elements:</p>
<ol>
    <li>M&aacute;quina</li>
    <li>HTTP Listener</li>
    <li>HTTPS Listener</li>
    <li>AJP Listener</li>
</ol>

<p>The host element provides a virtual host configuration while the three listeners provide connections of that type to the Undertow instance.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong><br/>
    Multiple servers may be configured, which allow deployments and servers to be completely isolated. This may be useful in certain scenarios such as multi-tenant environments.
