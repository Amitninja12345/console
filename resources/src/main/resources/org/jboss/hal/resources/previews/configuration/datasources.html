<p>The two general types of resources are referred to as datasources and XA datasources.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Non-XA datasources</strong> are used for applications which do not use transactions, or applications which use transactions with a single database.</li>
    <li><strong>XA datasources</strong> are used by applications whose transactions are distributed across multiple databases. XA datasources introduce additional overhead.</li>
</ul>
