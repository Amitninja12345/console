interfacesPreview=<p>A logical name for a network interface / IP address / host name to which sockets can be bound. The <code>domain.xml</code>, <code>host.xml</code> and <code>standalone.xml</code> configurations all include a section where interfaces can be declared. Other sections of the configuration can then reference those interfaces by their logical name, rather than having to include the full details of the interface (which may vary on different machines).</p><p>An interface configuration includes the logical name of the interface as well as information specifying the criteria to use for resolving the actual physical address to use.</p>

socketBindingsPreview=<p>A socket binding is a named configuration for a socket. The <code>domain.xml</code> and <code>standalone.xml</code> configurations both include a section where named socket configurations can be declared. Other sections of the configuration can then reference those sockets by their logical name, rather than having to include the full details of the socket configuration (which may vary on different machines).</p>
subsystemsPreview=<p>A set of subsystem configurations. A subsystem is an added set of capabilities added to the core server by an extension. As such a subsystem provides servlet handling capabilities, an EJB container, JTA support, etc.</p>
systemPropertiesPreview=<p>System property values can be set in a number of places in <code>domain.xml</code>, <code>host.xml</code> and <code>standalone.xml</code> . The values in <code>standalone.xml</code> are set as part of the server boot process. Values in <code>domain.xml</code> and <code>host.xml</code> are applied to servers when they are launched.</p>
