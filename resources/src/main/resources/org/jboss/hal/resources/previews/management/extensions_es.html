<p>Extensions are a way to add new features to the management console. They are written in JavaScript and should use the
    <a href="https://github.com/hal/hal.next/wiki/JavaScript-API">JavaScript API</a> to interact with the console and the management interface. If you want to develop an extension, see
    <a href="https://github.com/hal/hal.next/wiki/Extensions">https://github.com/hal/hal.next/wiki/Extensions</a> for more information.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="pficon pficon-warning-triangle-o"></span>Extensions are written in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and are
    <strong>injected</strong> into the browser. Please install only extensions that you trust!
</div>

<h2>Extension Points</h2>
<p>The console provides four different extension points which can be used by extensions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Header: Adds a menu item to the &quot;Extensions&quot; dropdown in the header</li>
    <li>Finder Item: Adds a new item to a specific finder column</li>
    <li>Footer: Adds a menu item to the &quot;Extensions&quot; dropdown in the footer</li>
    <li>Custom: It&#39;s up to the extension how to add itself to the console</li>
</ol>

<h2>Instalaci&oacute;n</h2>
<p>Extensions can be added to the console using two different ways:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Bundled Extensions</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Bundled extensions are part of the ${build.fullName} installation and installed as modules. They have to be installed outside of the console. WildFly and the console have to be restarted / reloaded after adding or removing bundled extensions.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Standalone Extensions</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Standalone extensions are hosted by a public available endpoint. This endpoint must serve a JSON file which contains metadata for the extension. You can add and remove standalone extensions using the management console. They&#39;re stored in the browser&#39;s local storage. As such they&#39;re scoped to the browser and URL which runs the management console.</p>
    </dd>
