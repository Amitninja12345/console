<p>Manage the deployments of a server group</p>
<p id="drag-and-drop-deployment">You can use
    <strong>drag and drop</strong> to add new deployments to the selected server group. Simply drag one or several files onto the deployment column. The deployments added by drag and drop will be disabled by default.
</p>
<p>Select one or several items from the content repository and deploy it to the selected server group.</p>
<p>Add unmanaged deployments. An unmanaged deployment points to a folder on the server's local file system. Compared to managed deployments, unmanaged deployments won't be copied (i.e. uploaded) to the server's deployment repository before they're deployed. The deployment content will remain at and be deployed directly from its original location.</p>
