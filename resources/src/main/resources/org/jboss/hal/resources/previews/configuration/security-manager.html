<p>Configure Java security policies to be used by the Java Security Manager.</p>
<p>The Java Security Manager is a class that manages the external boundary of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) sandbox, controlling how code executing within the JVM can interact with resources outside the JVM. When the Java Security Manager is activated, the Java API checks with the security manager for approval before executing a wide range of potentially unsafe operations. The Java Security Manager uses a security policy to determine whether a given action will be allowed or denied.</p>
