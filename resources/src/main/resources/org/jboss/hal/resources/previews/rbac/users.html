<p>What a management user is permitted to do is determined by the roles to which the user is assigned. A system of includes and excludes based on the user membership determines to which role a user belongs.</p>
<p>A user is considered to be assigned to a role if:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The user is:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>listed as a user to be included in the role, or</li>
        <li>a member of a group that is listed to be included in the role.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The user is not:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>listed as a user to exclude from the role, or</li>
        <li>a member of a group that is listed to be excluded from the role.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>Exclusions take priority over inclusions.</p>
