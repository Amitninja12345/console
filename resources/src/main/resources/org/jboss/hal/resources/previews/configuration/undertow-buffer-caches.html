<p>The buffer cache is used to cache static resources. JBoss EAP enables multiple caches to be configured and referenced by deployments, allowing different deployments to use different cache sizes. Buffers are allocated in regions and are a fixed size. The total amount of space used can be calculated by multiplying the buffer size by the number of buffers per region by the maximum number of regions. The default size of a buffer cache is 10MB.</p>
