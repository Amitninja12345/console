<p>JGroups is a toolkit for reliable messaging and can be used to create clusters whose nodes can send messages to each other.</p>
<p>The
    <code>jgroups</code> subsystem provides group communication support for high availability services in ${build.shortName}. It allows you to configure named channels and protocol stacks as well as view runtime statistics for channels. The
    <code>jgroups</code> subsystem is available when using a configuration that provides high availability capabilities, such as the
    <i>ha</i> or <i>full-ha</i> profile in a managed domain, or the <code>standalone-ha.xml</code> or
    <code>standalone-full-ha.xml</code> configuration file for a standalone server.</p>
<p>${build.shortName} is preconfigured with two JGroups stacks:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>udp</dt>
    <dd>The nodes in the cluster use User Datagram Protocol (UDP) multicasting to communicate with each other. This is the default stack.</dd>
    <dt>tcp</dt>
    <dd>The nodes in the cluster use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to communicate with each other.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can use the preconfigured stacks or define your own to suit your systemâ€™s specific requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/>
    TCP has more overhead and is often considered slower than UDP since it handles error checking, packet ordering, and congestion control itself. JGroups handles these features for UDP, whereas TCP guarantees them itself. TCP is a good choice when using JGroups on unreliable or high congestion networks, or when multicast is not available.
