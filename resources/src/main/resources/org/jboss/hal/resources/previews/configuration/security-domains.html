<p>A security domain consists of configurations for authentication, authorization, security mapping, and auditing. It implements Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) declarative security.</p>
<p>Authentication refers to verifying the identity of a user. In security terminology, this user is referred to as a principal. Although authentication and authorization are different, many of the included authentication modules also handle authorization.
</p>
<p>Authorization is a process by which the server determines if an authenticated user has permission or privileges to access specific resources in the system or operation.</p>
<p>Security mapping refers to the ability to add, modify, or delete information from a principal, role, or attribute before passing the information to your application.</p>
<p>The auditing manager allows you to configure provider modules to control the way that security events are reported.
If you use security domains, you can remove all specific security configuration from your application itself. This allows you to change security parameters centrally. One common scenario that benefits from this type of configuration structure is the process of moving applications between testing and production environments.</p>
