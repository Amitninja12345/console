<p>The Undertow subsystem allows you to configure the web server and servlet container settings. It implements the
    <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=340" target="_blank">Java Servlet 3.1 Specification</a> as well as websockets and supports HTTP Upgrade and using high performance non-blocking handlers in servlet deployments. The Undertow subsystem also has the ability to act as a high performance reverse proxy which supports mod_cluster.
</p>

<p>Within the Undertow subsystem, there are six main components to configure:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Undertow Configuration</li>
    <li>Buffer Caches</a></li>
    <li>Server</a></li>
    <li>Servlet Container</a></li>
    <li>Handlers</a></li>
    <li>Filters</a></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Important</strong><br/>
    The Undertow subsystem also relies on the IO subsystem to provide XNIO workers and buffer pools. The IO subsystem is configured separately and provides a default configuration which should give optimal performance in most cases.
