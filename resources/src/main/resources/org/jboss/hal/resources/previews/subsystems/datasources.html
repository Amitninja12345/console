<p>The datasource subsystem allows you to create and configure datasources and manage JDBC database drivers.</p>
<h2>Datasources</h2>
<p>The two general types of resources are referred to as datasources and XA datasources.
<ul>
    <li>Non-XA datasources are used for applications which do not use transactions, or applications which use transactions with a single database.</li>
    <li>XA datasources are used by applications whose transactions are distributed across multiple databases. XA datasources introduce additional overhead.</li>
</ul>
<h2>JDBC</h2>
<p>The JDBC API is the standard that defines how databases are accessed by Java applications. An application configures a datasource that references a JDBC driver. Application code can then be written against the driver, rather than the database. The driver converts the code to the database language. This means that if the correct driver is installed, an application can be used with any supported database.</p>
