    <li>(Pooled) Connection Factories</li>
</ul>

<h2>Acceptors & Connectors</h2>
<p>An acceptor defines which types of connection are accepted by the ${build.shortName} embedded messaging server. You can define any number of acceptors per server.</p>

<p>A connector defines how to connect to an embedded ${build.shortName} messaging server, and is used by a client to make connections.</p>

<p>For more information about acceptors and connectors, see the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/7.0/paged/configuring-messaging/chapter-8-configuring-the-messaging-transports">Acceptors and Connectors section</a>.
</p>

<h2>Connector Services</h2>
<p>A connector service allows to integrate external components with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to send and receive messages.</p>

<h2>Connection Factories</h2>
<p>By default, the ${build.shortName} messaging subsystem provides the <code>InVmConnectionFactory</code> and
    <code>RemoteConnectionFactory</code> connection factories, as well as the
    <code>activemq-ra</code> pooled connection factory.</p>

<p><code>InVmConnectionFactory</code> references an
    <code>in-vm-connector</code> and can be used to send and receive messages when both the client and server are running in the same JVM.
    <code>RemoteConnectionFactory</code> references an
    <code>http-connector</code> and can be used to send and receive messages over HTTP when the client and server are running in different JVMs.
</p>

<p>Pooled connection factories allow you to configure the inbound and outbound connectors of the integrated ActiveMQ Artemis resource adapter. For more information on configuring a pooled-connection-factory to connect to a remote ActiveMQ Artemis server, see
    <a target="_blank" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/7.0/paged/configuring-messaging/chapter-30-resource-adapters#use_provided_amq_adapter">Using the Integrated Resource Adapter for Remote Connections</a>.
