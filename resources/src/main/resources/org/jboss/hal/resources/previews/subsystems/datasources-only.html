<p>The two general types of resources are referred to as datasources and XA datasources.
<ul>
    <li>Non-XA datasources are used for applications which do not use transactions, or applications which use transactions with a single database.</li>
    <li>XA datasources are used by applications whose transactions are distributed across multiple databases. XA datasources introduce additional overhead.</li>
</ul>
