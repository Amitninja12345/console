<p>A host controller is launched when the <code>domain.sh</code> or <code>domain.bat</code> script is run on a host.</p>

<p>The primary responsibility of a host controller is server management. It delegates domain management tasks and is responsible for starting and stopping the individual application server processes that run on its host.</p>

<p>It interacts with the domain controller to help manage the communication between the servers and the domain controller. Multiple host controllers of a domain can interact with only a single domain controller. Hence, all the host controllers and server instances running on a single domain mode have a single domain controller and must belong to the same domain.</p>

<p>By default each host controller reads its configuration from the
    <code>domain/configuration/host.xml</code> file located in the unzipped JBoss EAP 6 installation file on its host's filesystem. The
    <code>host.xml</code> file contains the following configuration information that is specific to the particular host:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The names of the JBoss EAP 6 instances meant to run from this installation.</li>
    <li>Any of the following configurations:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>How the host controller contacts the domain controller to register itself and access the domain configuration.</li>
        <li>How to find and contact a remote domain controller.</li>
        <li> That the host controller is to act as the domain controller</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Configurations specific to the local physical installation. For example, named interface definitions declared in
        <code>domain.xml</code> can be mapped to an actual machine-specific IP address in
        <code>host.xml</code>. And abstract path names in domain.xml can be mapped to actual filesystem paths in
        <code>host.xml</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
