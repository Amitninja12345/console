<p>JBoss EAP messaging includes a fully functional JMS message api. The function of a JMS api is to consume messages from a source queue or topic and send them to a target queue or topic, typically on a different server.</p>

<p>The source and target servers do not have to be in the same cluster, which makes bridging suitable for reliably sending messages from one cluster to another, for instance across a WAN, and where the connection may be unreliable.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note</strong><br/>Do not confuse a JMS api with a core api. A JMS api can be used to api any two JMS 1.1 compliant JMS providers and uses the JMS API. A core api is used to api any two JBoss EAP messaging instances and uses the core API. It is preferable to use a core api instead of a JMS api whenever possible.
