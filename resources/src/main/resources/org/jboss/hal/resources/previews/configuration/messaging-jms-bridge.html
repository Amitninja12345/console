<p>The function of a JMS bridge is to consume messages from a source queue or topic and send them to a target queue or topic, typically on a different server.</p>

<p>The source and target servers do not have to be in the same cluster, which makes bridging suitable for reliably sending messages from one cluster to another, for instance across a WAN, and where the connection may be unreliable.</p>
