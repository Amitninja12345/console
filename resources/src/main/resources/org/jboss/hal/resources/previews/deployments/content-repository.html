<p>The content repository holds all content uploaded to the domain controller. After being uploaded the content can be assigned to a server group.</p>

<p id="drag-and-drop-deployment">You can use <strong>drag and drop</strong> to add new content or replace existing content. Simply drag one or several files onto the content column. If there's already a content with the same name, the content will be replaced, otherwise the content will be added.</p>

<p>You can also add unmanaged deployments. An unmanaged deployment points to a folder on the server's local file system. Compared to managed deployments, unmanaged deployments won't be copied (i.e. uploaded) to the server's deployment repository before they're deployed. The deployment content will remain at and be deployed directly from its original location.</p>

<p>If a content is no longer assigned to a server group, you can remove the content again.</p>
