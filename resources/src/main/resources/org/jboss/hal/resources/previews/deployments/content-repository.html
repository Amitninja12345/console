<p>The content repository holds all content uploaded to the domain controller. After being uploaded the content can be assigned to a server group.</p>
<p id="drag-and-drop-deployment">You can also use <strong>drag and drop</strong> to add new content or replace existing deployments. Simply drag one or several files onto the 'Content' column. If there's already a deployment with the same name, the deployment will be replaced, otherwise the deployment will be added.
</p>
<p>If a deployment is no longer assigned to a server group, you can remove the deployment again.</p>
